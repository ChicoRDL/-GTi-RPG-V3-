	<item name="DX Drawing" 		groups="All Items,Misc Items" tags="DX,Direct,X,Draw,Drawing,Create,Creation,Make" 	description="The DX functions allow you to draw rudimentary shapes, images and text onto the screen. They offer more control than the GUI counterparts but are much more difficult to implement and maintain.\n\nBe aware that they are NOT GUI elements, nor can they be parented with or have any link with other GUI elements. They exist separately from the GUI and separately from each other.\n\nThey can be accessed through the 'Drawing' option on the main right click menu."/>
